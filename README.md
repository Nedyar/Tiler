# Tiler

Tiler is a project composed of two independent modules:

- **Generator** (Java)
- **Visualizer** (JavaScript)

Together, they allow generating all valid tile boards of size **N x M**
and visualizing them using sprites.

# 🔷 Generator (Java)

The **Generator** module is a Java program responsible for:

- Generating all valid boards of size **N x M**
- Using predefined tiles configured in the `Main` class
- Ensuring no duplicated boards are stored under full board rotation
- Saving the generated boards into JSON files
- Storing output files inside the `logs` directory

---

## ✅ Rotation Deduplication

The Generator guarantees that:

> Boards that are identical under complete board rotation are not stored
> multiple times.

This prevents redundant configurations and significantly reduces output
size.

---

## 📦 Output Size

Generated JSON files may be very large:

- Approximately **1GB total output** for boards greater than 4x4
- Automatically split into multiple files if necessary

This ensures the system can handle very large board spaces without
failing due to file size limits.

---

## 🧩 Preconfigured Tile Setups

The Generator includes two predefined tile configuration methods:

- `setUpAmonHen`
- `setUpAmonSun`

These methods:

- Predefine specific tile configurations
- Serve as examples of how to generate boards with pre-established
  tile sets
- Can be used as references for creating custom predefined tile
  configurations

---

## 🔄 How the Generator Works

1.  Tiles are configured in `Main`.
2.  Optionally use `setUpAmonHen` or `setUpAmonSun` for predefined
    setups.
3.  The program computes all valid board configurations.
4.  Duplicate boards under full rotation are discarded.
5.  Results are exported into JSON files.
6.  Files are saved inside the `logs` folder.

---

# 🔷 Visualizer (JavaScript)

The **Visualizer** module is a JavaScript program responsible for:

- Reading a JSON file generated by the Generator
- Selecting a random valid board
- Rendering the board visually
- Using sprite images stored in the `sprites` folder

---

## ⚠ Important File Requirement

The Visualizer expects:

- A file named exactly:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

    validBoards.json

- The file must be placed in the **root directory of the Visualizer module**
  (same level as `sprites`).

Even if the Generator outputs multiple files, you must combine or rename
the desired output file to:

    validBoards.json

and place it in the project root before running the Visualizer.

---

## 🖼 Sprites

All tile graphics used by the Visualizer are located in the `sprites`
directory.

Each tile type must have a corresponding sprite image.

---

## 🚀 Workflow

1.  Run the **Generator**.
2.  Generate valid boards (may produce multiple large JSON files in
    `logs/`).
3.  Prepare the desired JSON file:
    - Rename or merge into `validBoards.json`
    - Place it in the Visualizer root directory.
4.  Run the **Visualizer**.
5.  A random valid board will be displayed using the sprite assets.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Java** (Generator)
- **JavaScript** (Visualizer)
- JSON for data exchange between modules

---

## 📌 Notes

- Generated JSON files can be extremely large (\~1GB total).
- Large JSON files should not be committed to version control.
- It is recommended to regenerate them when needed instead of storing
  them in Git.
- Rotation-based deduplication significantly reduces redundant board
  configurations.
